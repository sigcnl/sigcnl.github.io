Fifth Workshop on Controlled Natural Language (CNL 20188)

25-27 July 2016 in Aberdeen, Scotland

This workshop on Controlled Natural Language (CNL) has a broad
scope and embraces all approaches that are based on natural language and apply
restrictions on vocabulary, grammar, and/or semantics. This includes (but is
certainly not limited to) approaches that have been called simplified language,
plain language, formalized language, processable language, fragments of
language, phraseologies, conceptual authoring, language generation, and guided
natural language interfaces.

Some CNLs are designed to improve communication among humans, especially for
non-native speakers of the respective natural language. In other cases, the
restrictions on the language are supposed to make it easier for computers to
analyze such texts in order to improve computer-aided, semi-automatic, or
automatic translations into other languages. A third group of CNL has the goal
to enable reliable automated reasoning and formal knowledge representation from
seemingly natural texts. All these types of CNL are covered by this workshop.
