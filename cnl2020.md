<p align="middle" style="font-size:200%">Seventh International Workshop on Controlled Natural Language (CNL 2020/21)</p>
<p align="middle"><strong>8/9 September 2021 â€” Amsterdam, Netherlands</strong></p>
<p align="middle"><strong>Co-located with <a href="https://2021-eu.semantics.cc/">SEMANTiCS 2021</a></strong></p>
<p align="middle"><strong>The proceedings are now available in the <a href="https://aclanthology.org/volumes/2021.cnl-1/">ACL Anthology</a></strong></p>


The workshop was originally planned for 2020 but was postponed to 2021 due to
Covid-19. The workshop will be a hybrid one: online as well as physical
participation will be possible.

This workshop on [Controlled Natural Language (CNL)](index.html) has a broad
scope and embraces all approaches that are based on natural language and apply
restrictions on vocabulary, grammar, and/or semantics. This includes (but is
certainly not limited to) approaches that have been called _simplified language,
plain language, formalized language, processable language, fragments of
language, phraseologies, conceptual authoring, language generation, and guided
natural language interfaces_.

Some CNLs are designed to improve communication among humans, especially for
non-native speakers of the respective natural language. In other cases, the
restrictions on the language are supposed to make it easier for computers to
analyze such texts in order to improve computer-aided, semi-automatic, or
automatic translations into other languages. A third group of CNL has the goal
to enable reliable automated reasoning and formal knowledge representation from
seemingly natural texts. All these types of CNL are covered by this workshop.


### Important Dates

- paper submission deadline: 16 May 2021 (extended)
- notification of acceptance: 22 June 2021
- camera-ready papers: 5 July 2021
- workshop: 8/9 September 2021

### Venue and Registration

The workshop will be at the [Meervaart Theatre in Amsterdam](https://2021-eu.semantics.cc/venue), together with the SEMANTiCS conference.
Online as well as physical participation will be possible.

You can register via the [SEMANTiCS registration system](https://2021-eu.semantics.cc/prices). To attend both CNL workshop days, you will need to minimally purchase two single day tickets (either online or onsite). The 4-day pass also includes the workshop days. We hope that most participants will choose to attend both workshop days, but registering for only one of the days is also possible.

- CNL for knowledge representation

### Submissions and Proceedings

We invite researchers to submit papers with novel contributions in the area of CNL. We are looking for two types of papers, formatted in [two-column ACL style](https://github.com/acl-org/ACLPUB/tree/master/templates):

- Full papers with novel research results and/or in-depth case descriptions should not exceed 8 pages (accepted papers will get a long presentation slot at the workshop)
- Short papers (including demo/white papers) that shortly introduce a system, approach, or opinion should not exceed 4 pages (accepted papers will get a shorter presentation slot at the workshop)

Submission should be done via EasyChair [here](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=cnl2020). Full and short paper will be peer-reviewed, and accepted papers will be published in the [ACL Anthology](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/).

There will also be a business track, for which you can submit extended abstracts:

- Business track abstracts of 1 or 2 pages (excluding graphics) describing a business application or business case (accepted abstracts will get a presentation slot in the business track session)
